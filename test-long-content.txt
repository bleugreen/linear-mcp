This is a test of the chunking functionality for Linear MCP. When content exceeds 65KB, it should be intelligently split into multiple comments with proper indicators.

This paragraph will be repeated many times to create a large amount of content that exceeds Linear's 65KB limit for a single comment or description field. The smart chunking algorithm should:

1. Try to split on paragraph boundaries when possible
2. Fall back to sentence boundaries if paragraphs are too long
3. As a last resort, split on word boundaries
4. Never truncate or lose any content
5. Add clear indicators showing which part of the content you're reading

Here's another paragraph with different content to add variety. The chunking system should handle various types of content including technical documentation, code snippets, long descriptions, and detailed specifications. It should preserve formatting and ensure readability across chunks.
